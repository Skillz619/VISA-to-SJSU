*Each review answers the above questions in detail.*

| Subject                                                         | Review from a student|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| __Enterprise Software Platforms - Richard Sinn__                | Core course for SE students and Prof works at Adobe and his course mainly consists of Networking, Encryption, Systems, Big Data, Cloud and PHP Devevelopement. Projects are mostly a full stack application level Eg: E-commerce Application. The course comprises of Labs, Assignments every week and has Mid Exam and a Final Exam mostly covered in the PPT's shared by the prof. All in all he shares his work experience and is friendly and approachable. Prof is linent on students and gives them time to complete and learn things in the class.|
| __Enterprise Software Platforms - Ben Reed__                    | Professor Ben Reed is one of Founding members at Yahoo and last worked with Meta before coming into full-time teaching profession. His way of teaching is very practical and demands deep understanding of concepts and self-study from the suggested text books to get good grades. The assignments give a good exposure to concepts widely used in distributed applications. Exams (Minor-1 Minor-2 and Major) mostly consists of MCQs and Short Answer Questions (Ans in 1-2 sentences). He is very strict towards plagiarsim but at the same time encourages students willing to put efforts to learn.
| __Cloud Technologies-Jerry Gao__                                | - Dr. Gao has vast experience in research in Cloud and AI. His project is a mixture of AI,Full stack web Applications, integrating datasets and models, the course has a mid term and a final exam with presentations and document reviews of your projects. The assignments are just a couple of them as most of the weightage is given my mids finals and project. His focus is mainly of submitting a research paper project requirements and encourages you to participate in conferences and submit projects for the journals.|
| __Software Systems Engineering__                                | .|
| __Machine Learning__                                            | .|
| __Enterprise Distributed Systems - Dr. Sriram Rao__             | Specialization core course for SE students. Course covers a good amount of theory and practical implementation for distributed systems. Theory is covered in a nice narrative way where the professor first introduces what the notion of time is in distributed systems, then explains how to order events across systems, how to reach consensus, how to function despite presence of faulty/rogue servers, etc. Lab assignments also build on top of each other, and are definitely challenging and time consuming but great for learning. Overall this course is slightly heavy, but you will definitely learn a lot of things and gain proficiency in implementing distributed algorithms.|
| __Computer Engineering Seminar (GWAR) - Dr. Tridha Chatterjee__ | This course is intended to train graduate students in technical communication and prepare them for the industry. The course does not have any mid / end semester exams, but it does have assignments every week. You will work on various formats of professional communication such as elevator pitches, group presentations, drafting onepagers, etc. Towards the end of the semester, students are expected to come up with a topic of interest, do a literature review of existing research on that topic and draft a technical paper citing atleast 10 research articles. Overall, course is quite fun and interesting, thanks to the friendly and warm nature of Tridha ma'am.|
